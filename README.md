incompressible-fluid
====================

Simulation of two-dimensional incompressible flow with periodic boundary conditions, achieved by solving the Euler Equations in the frequency domain.

Based on the following excellent resources:
- Stam, Jos. [*Stable Fluids*](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~chaol/data/cs777/stam-stable_fluids.pdf). SIGGRAPH 99, Los Angeles, CA.
