incompressible-fluid
====================

Simulation of two-dimensional incompressible flow with periodic boundary conditions, achieved by solving the Euler Equations in the frequency domain.

Based on the following excellent resources:
- Stam, Jos. [*Stable Fluids*](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~chaol/data/cs777/stam-stable_fluids.pdf). SIGGRAPH 99, Los Angeles, CA.
- Bridson, Robert, and Matthias MÃ¼ller-Fischer. [*Fluid Simulation*](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~rbridson/fluidsimulation/fluids_notes.pdf).  SIGGRAPH 07.  Course Notes.

The only file needed to run the simulation is the `*.jar` in the root directory.

### Known Issues
Currently, there are mysterious ridges in the simulation into which particles disappear.  This issue will be investigated in the future.
